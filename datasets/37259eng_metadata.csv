2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS

Definitions:

Birth
Data refer to live born children. 

Live born child 
A baby showing some sign of life after birth, regardless of the duration of pregnancy.
Live born children are recorded in the municipality of residence of the baby's mother (or occasionally the father). It is, therefore, not necessarily the municipality where the birth occurred. 

Death
Person declared dead by an authorized doctor.
Deaths represent the number of deaths in the 'de jure' population of the municipality of residence of the deceased, not the municipality where the death occurred.

Migration
A move between two geographic entities resulting in a change of municipality or country.
Excluding changes of address resulting of change of streetnames, housenumbers, municipal boundary etcetera.

Population
The total number of people residing in The Netherlands. 
In the population statistics compiled by Statistics Netherlands the inhabitants are the people registered in the population register of a Dutch municipality. 

Population growth
The increase or decrease of the population.

4. SOURCES AND METHODS

Municipal boundary changes of Rotterdam and Rozenburg in 2010
On 18 March 2010 the municipality Rozenburg was abolished and incorporated in the municipality of Rotterdam.For the purpose of clarity, all figures for births, mortality, external migration and intra-municipal migration in Rozenburg in 2010 have been included in those for Rotterdam. No data are available for population developments in Rozenburg in 2010. Population growth of Rotterdam refers to Rotterdam and Rozenburg together.

Break in series: late reports 
Until 2010, reports on events taking place in a certain year received by Statistics Netherlands after 15 February in the following year were disregarded. These are so-called late reports. 
As a result of an improvement in the production process, from 2010 these late reports are included in the year of publication (i.e. not in the year the event took place, but in the year the results are published). 

Break in series external migration
As a result of an improved production process, a small shift has occurred in the figures on external migration.
From 2010 the following changes have been implemented.
- administrative entries preceding emigration are now considered as immigration
- administrative removals followed by immigration are now considered as emigration.
From 2010 as a result of the improved production process the net other corrections is strong reduced.

Population
Observations are based on information supplied to Statistics Netherlands by the Municipal population register.

Accuracy and reliability
In a limited number of cases the data received by Statistics Netherlands are incomplete. In such cases the missing data are estimated.

Used external sources
The figures are based on information as reported to Statistics Netherlands by the municipal population registrations.

Administrative correction:

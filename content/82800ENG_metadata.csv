This table contents information of the Regional accounts.
Regional accounts give a description of the economic process in the regions of a country in conformity with the national accounts. Elements in the economic process distinguished in national accounts are production, distribution of  income, spending and financing. Regional accounts focus on the description of the production processes in the various regions.
The new Standard industrial classification 2008 (SIC 2008) is used in the National and Regional Accounts of the Netherlands.
This code is based on the European classification Nomenclature générale des Activités économiques dans la Communauté Européenne (NACE Rev. 2) which is used in all Member States of the European Union. 


Data available from: 1996 up to and including 2017.

Status of the figures:
Data from 1996 up to and including 2015 are final. Data of 2016 and 2017 are provicional. Since this table has been discontinued, data of 2016 and 2017 will not become final.

Changes as of November 23rd, 2018:
None. This table has been discontinued. 
Statistics Netherlands has carried out a revision of the national accounts. New statistical sources and estimation methods have been used during the revision.

2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS

Definitions:

Volume change gross domestic product and gross value added:

Volume developments of the value added reflect changes in volume and quality of the goods and services produced minus the goods and services used up in the production process. 
On the national level, the value of used and consumed goods are adjusted for price fluctuations (double inflation method). Volume developments are calculated on the basis of last year's prices (stable prices). This method is not compatible with regional accounts.
In the first place the regional accounts are made by sector and not for a classification of goods (products). Exceptions to this rule are the sectors Agriculture, Mining and Oil-industry where production and consumption are allocated to regions, on the basis of the production of goods. Secondly there are no price index figures for regions made by Statistics Netherlands.

Explanation of symbols used in the table:

empty cell	: figure not applicable
. 		: figure is unknown, insufficiently reliable or confidential
* 		: provisional figure
** 		: revised provisional figure (but not definite)
